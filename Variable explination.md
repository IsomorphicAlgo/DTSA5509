**Production Metrics**

* **ProductionVolume:** 
    * Higher production volumes might lead to increased stress on machinery and processes, potentially increasing the likelihood of defects. 
    * Alternatively, higher volumes might indicate smoother operations and fewer disruptions, leading to lower defect rates.

* **ProductionCost:** 
    * Higher costs could imply the use of better quality materials or more stringent processes, which might reduce defects.
    * Conversely, it might indicate inefficiencies or problems in the production line, potentially leading to more defects.

**Supply Chain and Logistics**

* **SupplierQuality:**
    * Lower supplier quality ratings could directly translate to lower-quality components or materials, increasing the chance of defects in the final product.

* **DeliveryDelay:**
    * Delays might disrupt production schedules, leading to rushed processes or the use of suboptimal materials to compensate, potentially increasing defects.

**Quality Control and Defect Rates**

* **DefectRate & QualityScore:** 
    * These are likely to be highly correlated with the target variable (DefectStatus) and serve as direct indicators of quality issues. 
    * However, understanding their relationship with other variables can offer insights into the root causes of defects.

**Maintenance and Downtime**

* **MaintenanceHours & DowntimePercentage:** 
    * Inadequate maintenance or frequent downtime could indicate equipment issues or process instability, both of which are likely to contribute to higher defect rates.

**Inventory Management**

* **InventoryTurnover & StockoutRate:**
    * High turnover or frequent stockouts might suggest rushed production or supply chain issues, potentially leading to compromises in quality and increased defects.

**Workforce Productivity and Safety**

* **WorkerProductivity & SafetyIncidents:**
    * Lower productivity or higher safety incident rates might indicate a stressed or poorly trained workforce, increasing the likelihood of errors and defects.

**Energy Consumption and Efficiency**

* **EnergyConsumption & EnergyEfficiency:** 
    * High energy consumption or low efficiency could signal problems in the production equipment or processes, potentially contributing to quality issues.

**Additive Manufacturing (If Applicable)**

* **AdditiveProcessTime & AdditiveMaterialCost:**
    * Longer process times or higher material costs might indicate complexity in the additive manufacturing process, potentially increasing the risk of defects.

**Target Variable**

* **DefectStatus:**
    * This is the binary outcome variable -
