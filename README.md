For the DTSA 5509 final project we are asked to find a data set And develop some sort of question or problem that we are looking to solve using machine learning. For my project I am beginning with a data set I found on Kaggle that was created synthetically by Rabie El Kharoua (Kharoua 2024). The data set is designed to enable students to practice creating various classification models using data crafted to mimic various metrics and attributes of the manufacturing process. This essentially allows us to mimic the function of attempting to find defects in the manufacturing process and identify what attributes and features play the most important role and what features might not be useful and can be cut from the process.
